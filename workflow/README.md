Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Step 1. MIDI Disassembly

Convert a standard multi-track MIDI file into text using the [Make Text] function.

The resulting MIDI-TEXT file preserves all event-level information (pitch, timing, channel, tempo).

Step 2. Track-Level Inspection

Identify the melody track (e.g., Track #1 / Channel 1).

Identify accompaniment tracks (e.g., harmony or bass on Track #2).

No timing or structural edits are performed at this stage.

Step 3. Harmony-Aware Melody Regeneration

Provide the complete MIDI-TEXT to an LLM.

Instruct the model to regenerate only the melody channel.

Optional constraints include:

Pitch range

Maximum melodic interval

Stepwise preference

Awareness of accompaniment chord tones

All other channels, timing, and formatting must remain unchanged.

Step 4. MIDI Reassembly

Convert the modified MIDI-TEXT back into a standard MIDI file using [Make MIDI].

The resulting file is immediately usable in singing synthesis systems.

Demonstration Case Study

The demo uses an 8-bar children’s song (Two Tigers) to illustrate three levels of melody variation:

Additive Variation
Preserves contour with additional passing tones.

Contour-Based Variation
Alters melodic shape while maintaining rhythmic structure.

Harmony-Functional Variation
Regenerates melody with clear chord-tone interaction, highlighting harmonic function.

All regenerated MIDI files:

Preserve original accompaniment exactly

Maintain identical note onsets and durations

Are fully reassembled without MIDI errors

Educational Motivation

In singing synthesis education, instructors often reuse high-quality accompaniments generated by commercial tools. However, manually recomposing melodies for each pedagogical scenario is inefficient.

This repository demonstrates an alternative SOP where:

AI assists melody variation only

Instructors remain reviewers and listeners

Symbolic transparency ensures trust and reproducibility

The concept of singability is treated as a practical constraint, enforced through symbolic parameters rather than subjective style prompts.

Limitations

The workflow operates at the symbolic MIDI level and does not generate audio directly.

Harmonic awareness is implicit, derived from accompaniment tracks rather than explicit chord labels.

Expressive parameters (dynamics, articulation) are not yet included.

These limitations are discussed in detail in the accompanying paper.

This repository is intended for research and educational purposes only.
The MIDI File Disassembler/Assembler is redistributed in accordance with its original terms as archived. Users are responsible for ensuring appropriate usage rights for any MIDI content they process.
